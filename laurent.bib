  Title = {Overlaps and Gender Analysis in the Context of Broadcast Media},
  Author = {Martin Lebourdais, Marie Tahon, Antoine Laurent, Sylvain Meignier, Anthony Larcher},
  Abstract = {Our main goal is to study the interactions between speakers according to their gender and role in broadcast media. In this paper, we propose an extensive study of gender and overlap annotations in various speech corpora mainly dedicated to diarisation or transcription tasks. We point out the issue of the heterogeneity of the annotation guidelines for both overlapping speech and gender categories. On top of that, we analyse how the speech content (casual speech, meetings, debate, interviews, etc.) impacts the distribution of overlapping speech segments. On a small dataset of 93 recordings from LCP French channel, we intend to characterise the interactions between speakers according to their gender. Finally, we propose a method which aims to highlight active speech areas in terms of interactions between speakers. Such a visualisation tool could improve the efficiency of qualitative studies conducted by researchers in human sciences.},

  Author = {Rémi Uro, David Doukhan, Albert Rilliard, Laetitia Larcher, Anissa-Claire Adgharouamane, Marie Tahon, Antoine Laurent},
  Abstract = {This paper presents a semi-automatic approach to create a diachronic corpus of voices balanced for speaker’s age, gender, and recording period, according to 32 categories (2 genders, 4 age ranges and 4 recording periods). Corpora were selected at French National Institute of Audiovisual (INA) to obtain at least 30 speakers per category (a total of 960 speakers; only 874 have be found yet). For each speaker, speech excerpts were extracted from audiovisual documents using an automatic pipeline consisting of speech detection, background music and overlapped speech removal and speaker diarization, used to present clean speaker segments to human annotators identifying target speakers. This pipeline proved highly effective, cutting down manual processing by a factor of ten. Evaluation of the quality of the automatic processing and of the final output is provided. It shows the automatic processing compare to up-to-date process, and that the output provides high quality speech for most of the selected excerpts. This method shows promise for creating large corpora of known target speakers.},

  Abstract = {This papers aims at improving spoken language modeling (LM) using very large amount of automatically transcribed speech. We leverage the INA (French National Audiovisual Institute) collection and obtain 19GB of text after applying ASR on 350,000 hours of diverse TV shows. From this, spoken language models are trained either by fine-tuning an existing LM (FlauBERT) or through training a LM from scratch. The new models (FlauBERT-Oral) are shared with the community and are evaluated not only in terms of word prediction accuracy but also for two downstream tasks: classification of TV shows and syntactic parsing of speech. Experimental results show that FlauBERT-Oral is better than its initial FlauBERT version demonstrating that, despite its inherent noisy nature, ASR-Generated text can be useful to improve spoken language modeling.},

  Author = {Hervé Bredin, Antoine Laurent},
  Abstract = {Speaker segmentation consists in partitioning a conversation between one or more speakers into speaker turns. Usually addressed as the late combination of three sub-tasks (voice activity detection, speaker change detection, and overlapped speech detection), we propose to train an end-to-end segmentation model that does it directly. Inspired by the original end-to-end neural speaker diarization approach (EEND), the task is modeled as a multi-label classification problem using permutation-invariant training. The main difference is that our model operates on short audio chunks (5 seconds) but at a much higher temporal resolution (every 16ms). Experiments on multiple speaker diarization datasets conclude that our model can be used with great success on both voice activity detection and overlapped speech detection. Our proposed model can also be used as a post-processing step, to detect and correctly assign overlapped speech regions. Relative diarization error rate improvement over the best considered baseline (VBx) reaches 18% on AMI, 17% on DIHARD 3, and 16% on VoxConverse.},

Founded during the liberation of France, this state-owned company filmed more than 20,000 news reports shown in French cinemas and throughout the world over its 24 years of activity. The project brings together research organizations with a dual historical and technological perspective. ANTRACT’s goal is to study the production process, the film content, the way historical events are represented and the audience reception of Les Actualités Françaises newsreels using innovative AI-based data processing tools developed by partners specialized in image, audio, and text analysis. This article focuses on the data processing apparatus and tools of the project. Automatic content analysis is used to select data, to segment video units and typescript images, and to align them with their archival description. Automatic speech recognition provides a textual representation and natural language processing can extract named entities from the voice-over recording; automatic visual analysis is applied to detect and recognize faces of well-known characters in videos. These multifaceted data can then be queried and explored with the TXM text-mining platform. The results of these automatic analysis processes are feeding the Okapi platform, a client-server software that integrates documentation, information retrieval, and hypermedia capabilities within a single environment based on the Semantic Web standards. The complete corpus of Les Actualités Françaises, enriched with data and metadata, will be made available to the scientific community by the end of the project.},

  Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end sequence-to-sequence spoken language understanding model using an attention mechanism. It reliably selects contextual acoustic features in order to hypothesize semantic contents. An initial architecture capable of extracting all pronounced words and concepts from acoustic spans is designed and tested. With a shallow fusion language model, this system reaches a 13.6 concept error rate (CER) and an 18.5 concept value error rate (CVER) on the French MEDIA corpus, achieving an absolute 2.8 points reduction compared to the state-of-the-art. Then, an original model is proposed for hypothesizing concepts and their values. This transduction reaches a 15.4 CER and a 21.6 CVER without any new type of context.},

  Abstract = {Probabilistic Latent Variable Models (LVMs) provide an alternative to self-supervised learning approaches for linguistic representation learning from speech. LVMs admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation where the latent structure shapes the information extracted from the signal. Even though LVMs have recently seen a renewed interest due to the introduction of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), their use for speech representation learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Convolutional Deep Markov Model (ConvDMM), a Gaussian state-space model with non-linear emission and transition functions modelled by deep neural networks. This unsupervised model is trained using black box variational inference. A deep convolutional neural network is used as an inference network for structured variational approximation. When trained on a large scale speech dataset (LibriSpeech), ConvDMM produces features that significantly outperform multiple self-supervised feature extracting methods on linear phone classification and recognition on the Wall Street Journal dataset. Furthermore, we found that ConvDMM complements self-supervised methods like Wav2Vec and PASE, improving on the results achieved with any of the methods alone. Lastly, we find that ConvDMM features enable learning better phone recognizers than any other features in an extreme low-resource regime with few labeled training examples.},

  Author = {Sameer Khurana and Antoine Laurent and James Glass},
  Abstract = {More than half of the 7,000 languages in the world are in imminent danger of going extinct. Traditional methods of documenting language proceed by collecting audio data followed by manual annotation by trained linguists at different levels of granularity. This time consuming and painstaking process could benefit from machine learning. Many endangered languages do not have any orthographic form but usually have speakers that are bi-lingual and trained in a high resource language. It is relatively easy to obtain textual translations corresponding to speech. In this work, we provide a multimodal machine learning framework for speech representation learning by exploiting the correlations between the two modalities namely speech and its corresponding text translation. Here, we construct a convolutional neural network audio encoder capable of extracting linguistic representations from speech. The audio encoder is trained to perform a speech-translation retrieval task in a contrastive learning framework. By evaluating the learned representations on a phone recognition task, we demonstrate that linguistic representations emerge in the audio encoder's internal representations as a by-product of learning to perform the retrieval task.},

  Abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate methods for reliable and efficient training of discrete representation using Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder models (VQ-VAEs). Discrete latent variable models have been shown to learn nontrivial representations of speech, applicable to unsupervised voice conversion and reaching state-of-the-art performance on unit discovery tasks. For unsupervised representation learning, they became viable alternatives to continuous latent variable models such as the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). However, training deep discrete variable models is challenging, due to the inherent non-differentiability of the discretization operation. In this paper we focus on VQ-VAE, a state-of-the-art discrete bottleneck model shown to perform on par with its continuous counterparts. It quantizes encoder outputs with on-line k-means clustering. We show that the codebook learning can suffer from poor initialization and non-stationarity of clustered encoder outputs. We demonstrate that these can be successfully overcome by increasing the learning rate for the codebook and periodic date-dependent codeword re-initialization. As a result, we achieve more robust training across different tasks, and significantly increase the usage of latent codewords even for large codebooks. This has practical benefit, for instance, in unsupervised representation learning, where large codebooks may lead to disentanglement of latent representations.},

Low-resourced languages are characterized by limited training materials, which typically results in high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates and poor language model estimates. One technique makes use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using word or subword units. Word-based RNNs keep the same system vocabulary, so they cannot reduce the OOV, whereas subword units can reduce the OOV but generate many false combinations. A complementary technique is based on automatic machine translation, which requires parallel texts and is able to add words to the vocabulary. These methods were accessed on 10 languages in the context of the Babel program and NIST OpenKWS evaluation. Although improvements vary across languages with both methods, small gains were generally observed in terms of word error rate reduction and improved keyword search performance.},

Target language texts collected from the Web and filtered to select conversational-like data are used in several manners. In addition to using Web data for training the language model of the speech recognizer, we further investigate using this data to improve the language model and phrase table of the MT system to get better translations of the English data. Finally, generating text data with a character-based recurrent neural network is investigated. This approach allows new word forms to be produced, providing a way to reduce the out-of-vocabulary rate and thereby improve keyword spotting performance. We study how these different methods of language model data augmentation impact speech-to-text and keyword spotting performance for the Lithuanian and Amharic languages.

The language recognition system results from a fusion of four core classifiers: a phonotactic component using DNN acoustic models, two purely acoustic components using a RNN model and and i-vector model, and a lexical component. Each component generates language posterior probabilities optimized to maximize the LID NCE, making their combination simple and robust. The motivation for using multiple components representing different speech knowledge is that some dialect distinctions may not be manifest at the acoustic level. We report experiments on the NIST LRE15 data and provide an analysis of the results and some post-evaluation contrasts.  The 2015 LRE task focused on the identification of 20 languages clustered in 6 groups (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Slavic and Iberic) of similar languages.

The techinques were explored in the context of the IARPA-Babel Active Learning (AL) task for 6 languages. Different selection criteria were explored with the goal of improving over a system built using a predefined 3 hour training data set. Four variants of the entropy-based criterion were explored: words, triphones, phones as well as the use of HMM-states previously introduced in (see IS 2015 bellow). The influence of the number of HMM-states was assessed as well as whether automatic or manual reference transcripts were used. The combination of selection criteria was investigated, and a novel multi-stage selection method proposed. These methods were also assessed using larger data sets than were permitted in the Babel AL task. Results are reported for the 6 languages. The multi-stage selection was also applied to the surprise language (Swahili) in the NIST OpenKWS 2015 evaluation.},

Given an initial training data set, we aim to automatically select additional data (from an untranscribed pool data set) for manual transcription. Initial and selected data are then used to build acoustic and language models for speech recognition. The goal of the AL task is to outperform a baseline system built using a pre-defined data selection with the same amount of data, the Very Limited Language Pack (VLLP) condition. AL methods based on different selection criteria have been explored. Compared to the VLLP baseline, improvements are obtained in terms of Word Error Rate and Actual Term Weighted Values for the Lithuanian language. A description of methods and an analysis of the results are given. The AL selection also outperforms the VLLP baseline for other IARPA- Babel languages, and will be further tested in the upcoming NIST OpenKWS 2015 evaluation.},

De nombreuses études font ressortir l'algorithme de boosting sur des règles de décision simples comme l'un des plus efficaces à combiner ces différents descripteurs. Nous proposons ici une modification de cet algorithme état-de-l'art en remplaçant ces règles de décision simples par des mini arbres de décision que nous appelons bonzaïs. Les expériences comparatives menées sur le corpus EPAC montrent que cette modification améliore largement les performances du système tout en réduisant le temps d'apprentissage de manière conséquente.},

	Abstract={Accurate phonetic transcription of proper nouns can be an important resource for commercial applications that embed speech technologies, such as audio indexing and vocal phone directory lookup. However, an accurate phonetic transcription is more difficult to obtain for proper nouns than for regular words. Indeed, phonetic transcription of a proper noun depends on both the origin of the speaker pronouncing it and the origin of the proper noun itself.This work proposes a method that allows the extraction of phonetic transcriptions of proper nouns using actual utterances of those proper nouns, thus yielding transcriptions based on practical use instead of mere pronunciation rules.The proposed method consists in a process that first extracts phonetic transcriptions, and then iteratively filters them. In order to initialize the process, an alignment dictionary is used to detect word boundaries. A rule-based grapheme-to-phoneme generator (LIA_PHON), a knowledge-based approach (JSM), and a Statistical Machine Translation based system were evaluated for this alignment.  As a result, compared to our reference dictionary (BDLEX supplemented by LIA_PHON for missing words) on the ESTER 1 French broadcast news corpus, we were able to significantly decrease the Word Error Rate (WER) on segments of speech with proper nouns, without negatively affecting the WER on the rest of the corpus.},

   Abstract = {This paper investigates unsupervised training strategies for the Korean language in the context of the DGA RAPID Rapmat project. As with previous studies, we begin with only a small amount of manually transcribed data to build preliminary acoustic models. Using the initial models, a larger set of untranscribed audio data is decoded to produce approximate transcripts. We compare both GMM and DNN acoustic models for both the unsupervised transcription and the final recognition system. While the DNN acoustic models produce a lower word error rate on the test set, training on the transcripts from the GMM system provides the best overall performance. We also achieve better performance by expanding the original phone set. Finally, we examine the efficacy of automatically building a test set by comparing system performance both before and after manually correcting the test set.},

   Abstract = {In this article, we tackle the problem of speaker role detection from broadcast news shows. In the literature, many proposed solutions are based on the combination of various features coming from acoustic, lexical and semantic information with a machine learning algorithm. Many previous studies mention the use of boosting over decision stumps to combine efficiently these features. In this work, we propose a modification of this state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm changing the weak learner (decision stumps) by small decision trees, denoted bonsai trees. Experiments show that using bonsai trees as weak learners for the boosting algorithm largely improves both system error rate and learning time.},

  Abstract = {We address the problem of named speaker identification in TV broadcast which consists in answering the question ``who speaks when?'' with the real identity of speakers, using person names automatically obtained from speech transcripts. While existing approaches rely on a first speaker diarization step followed by a local name propagation step to speaker clusters, we propose a unified framework called person instance graph where both steps are jointly modeled as a global optimization problem, then solved using integer linear programming. Moreover, when available, acoustic speaker models can be added seamlessly to the graph structure for joint named and acoustic speaker identification -- leading to a 10% error decrease (from 45% down to 35%) over a state-of-the-art i-vector speaker identification system on the REPERE TV broadcast corpus.},

Korean is an alpha-syllabary language spoken by about 78 million people worldwide.  As only a small amount of manually transcribed audio data were available, the acoustic models were trained on audio data downloaded from several Korean websites in an unsupervised manner, and the language models were trained on web texts. The reported word and character error rates are estimates, as development corpus used in these experiments was also constructed from the untranscribed audio data, the web texts and automatic transcriptions. Several variants for unsupervised acoustic model training were compared to assess the influence of the vocabulary size (200k vs 2M), the type of language model (words vs characters), the acoustic unit (phonemes vs half-syllables), as well as incremental batch vs iterative decoding of the untranscribed audio corpus.},
